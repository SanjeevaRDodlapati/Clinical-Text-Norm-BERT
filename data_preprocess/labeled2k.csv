"wbc was on admission and trended down with abx; however, c.diff toxin neg x, so diagnosis remains presumptive."
c. diff b toxin was sent and was negative as well.
"she completed a week course of po vanco and iv flagyl antibiotics, which was completed on ."
"she subsequently remained afebrile without further diarrhea, and was able to tolerate po's. )"
pt began having episodes of brbpr on with resultant slow hct drop.
gi and surgery were consulted.
"pt had no abdominal pain, but given recent surgery and low albumin, we were concerned that the bleed may be evidence of ischemic bowel or dehiscence."
"pt was also having intermittent episodes of tachycardia, raising the possibility that she was having embolic phenomena with acute ischemia."
"however, she had no abdominal pain to suggest this."
"colonoscopy was done on , showing severe c dif vs. ischemic bowel."
surgery found that pt was not surgical candidate and believed her bleeding and mucosal damage was c dif and would continue to improve.
"biopsy results showed no evidence of c.dif, but given pt's tenuous status, po vanco and iv flagyl were continued while awaiting toxin b. it is quite possible that the mucosal changes seen on colonoscopy were the result of c dif infxn, which had been treated w/abx and resolved, leaving the mucosae to heal."
"as well, gi felt there may be a superimposed ischemic insult."
"no further work-up was performed since she had good clinical resolution of her colitis, following completion of cdiff treatment. )"
acute renal failure w/ cri- renal team was consulted on admisison.
"baseline cr is approx on admission this was significantly elevated to fena was c/w prerenal etiology and patient had r ij placed in ed, started on ns for volume resusciation."
this was undertaken slowly given that pt had an albumin of and pleural effusions were noted on ct.
fluids were changed to /ns w/ bicarb on hd cr trended down each day and the patient has maintained oxygenation.
alb/cr ratio not c/w nephrotic range proteinuria- thus it was felt that the low alb was likely multifactorial.
pt initially required boluses of cc ns to maintain uop ~-cc/hr.
"with hydration and improvement in her diarrhea, her cr steadily decreased and returned to baseline of she was seen by renal who felt that her increase in creatinine may have been secondary to atn/hypotension and recommended avoiding aggressive overdiuresis."
she did subsequently require aggressive diuresis given her rapid afib/chf with lasix and niseritide drips.
however her creatinine remained at baseline of - with diuresis.
"she did develop a transient metabolic alkalosis, which was felt likely from volume contraction alkalosis."
therefore her lasix was weaned to mg daily and her bicarb trended back down to her creatinine was stable at at the time of discharge. )
pt was noted to be mildly thrombocytopenic on admisison.
unclear why it was low when patient presented.

her plt count rose as her clinical condition improved and remained in normal range for the duration of her hosital course. )
htn - pt's baseline sbp is in the s-s range.
"on admission, bp was low rd spacing and early sepsis."
her bp responded to fluids and she remained relatively normotensive.
she was continued on metoprolol for hr/bp control and isordil/hydral was added for afterload reduction. )
chf - evidence of chf on initial cxr.
"her ef was found to be % (previously normal), bringing up concern for ischemic event precipitating her failure."
in support of this she was noted to have wall motion abnormalities on echo with inferoseptal/basal hypokinesis.
diagnostic catheritization was not performed due to her renal insufficiency and decompensated chf.
"she was managed medically, and on the chf service was consulted for management."

"diuresed well to this and maintained bp well, however after increasing natrecor to , went back into rapid afib."
stopped natrecor on .
stopped lasix gtt on given persistent good diuresis.
now tapered down to mg daily lasix/day + afterload reduction w/ isordil/hydral on .
"at the time of discharge, she was felt to be euvolemic with goal of matching ins and outs daily."
we will continue her on this regimen upon discharge.
atrial fibrillation: initially converted from raf by medical cardioversion performed with procainamide gtt in the ccu at mg/kg/hr xmin load followed by mg/hr for h trial.
"became hypotensive to 's systolic, but subsequently recovered."
then again went into raf on early am.
initially hr controlled w/ iv lopressor/iv dilt.
then medical cardioversion w/ procainamide.
"became hypotensive to 's systolic after about minutes on procainamide , this was stopped and her blood pressures normalized."
she then converted min later to nsr.
she has been in nsr the remainder of her hospital course.
she is not on coumadin due to risk for bleed.
"in addition, amiodorone was discussed as a medical option for continued rythm control."
"however, given the side effect profile, the family and patient were more comfortable with holding off on adding amiodorone at this time."
they understand that there is a higher risk of conversion back to atrial fibrillation and increased risk for stroke without amiodorone.
"we will continue rate control with metoprolol as mentioned at mg tid, and may titrate up as needed to maintain hr < cad- wall motion abnormalities on echo w/ inferoseptal/basal hk."

continuing with medical management.
on statin/b-blocker.
no plan for cath at this time given her renal insuff/co-morbiditites.
also holding off on aspirin currently given her bleed risk.
this will be re-addressed as an outpatient through her pcp . .
anemia- initially had episode of gi bleed with blood loss anemia requiring units of packed red blood cells.
hematocrit subsequently normalized.
"however, she subsequently was noted to have a low, but stable, hematocrit at - repeat stool guaiacs were all negative and she had no further evidence of bleed or hemolysis."
"iron stores were also found to be within normal limits, with low tibc and high ferritin suggesting anemia of chronic disease."
this was felt likely secondary to chronic renal insufficiency.
"she was started on epo , units q m,w,fr on ."
"the goal transfusion criteria would be given her history of cad, however, we have held off on further transfusion at this time given her known chf with recent severe volume overload."
"we have set transfusion goal at hct>, and transfused with unit packed red blood cells and mg iv lasix for hct < tachypnea- resolved."
her transient tachypnea was felt likely secondary to volume overload.
there was no evidence of infiltrate by cxr.
her abg at the time on showed // her respiratory status subsequently improved that same day on following iv lasix and atrovent nebulizers.
avoided albuterol nebulizers over concern for tachycardia.
f/e/n- started on tpn for nutritional supplementation.
she also had a swallow study which showed ability to tolerated regular solids and thin liquids.
"she has been taking in po's as tolerated, but has continued to require tpn to reach nutritional goals."

"discharge labs: brief hospital course: primary reason for admission yof with h/o dilated cardiomyopathy (ef %), aicd p/w sob and poor urine output for several days found to have hyponatremia, now transferred from medicine to ccu due to hypotension. . active issues: . #"
acute on chronic systolic heart failure: the patient was hypervolemic on exam with elevated jvp and increased abdominal distension at presentation.
"given the patient had been refractory to diuretic therapy requiring ultrafiltration during her last hospitalization and was oliguric and hyponatremic on admission, ultrafiltration was initiated rather than diuretic therapy."
she experienced significant muscle cramping and hypotension while on cvvhd requiring dopamine.
cvvhd was discontinued on hd# and she was diuresed with iv lasix and metolazone.
pressures improved and she was weaned off of dopamine.
it was noted that urine and blood pressure improved when the patient was in her native sinus rhythm with asynchronous ventricular pacing.
therefore the patients pacemaker escape rate was lowered to allow for increased native rhythm and the mode was changed to aair.
despite this change urine output remained poor and she was therefore started on a lasix drip ultimately requiring milrinone to augment diuresis.
"on hd# patient underwent placement of a tunneled dialysis catheter, and on hd# she continued hd using the tunneled line (see below)."
lasix and metolazone were discontinued as patient will be hd dependent. . #
hypotension: patient was hypotensive on admission in the setting of volume overload.
her hypotension was believed to be due to worsening cardiac output in setting of dilated cardiomyopathy.
"she was temporarily on a dopamine gtt, but this was weaned by hd# in addition, she experienced episodes of hypotension with cvvh with diuresis and antihypertensive medications, so her antihypertensive medications were held."
"on discharge, her bp was stable."
she was asked to continue to hold her carvedilol and to follow up with her pcp about restarting as tolerated. . #
"hyponatremia: pts sodium was on admission and likely cause of her ams, thought to be hypervolemic hyponatremia with poor renal perfusion given e/o volume overload on exam and low urine na."
"her fluid intake was restricted to l daily, and she started cvvh as above with improvement in her hyponatremia as well as her mental status."
at the time of discharge her sodium was . #
"acute on chronic renal failure: patient was noted to have a creat of , baseline -, and oliguria x - days on admission."
as stated above she had previously required ultrafiltration during hospitalizations for heart failure exacerbation.
renal was consulted and felt that the patient would require chronic hd.
given her hypotension she was initally started on cvvh with dopamine gtt for pressure support.
however as above she did not tolerate cvvh and it was discontinued.
"she was diuresed with lasix gtt and milrinone as above until she had her tunneled line placed on hd# she tolerated hd well, with stable bp and no muscle cramping."
"outpatient dialysis was arranged with dialysis center for mondays, wednesdays and fridays. . #"
afib: pt has a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin at home.
on admission her coumadin was held in preparation for placement of a tunneled dialysis catheter.
as stated above her pacemaker settings were changed and she was in sinus rhythm for most of her ccu course with heart rates in the -s.
her mode was changed to aair to allow for intrinsice av conduction and minimize ventricular pacing in an abnormal heart.
her coumadin was restarted at her home dose on hd# her inr at the time of discharge was # stable issues: . #
"copd: patient's recent cough and sob with h/o copd was initially c/f copd exacerbation, and she was initially started on prednisone and levofloxacin."
however there was no wheezing on exam therefore prednisone and antibiotics were discontinued.
"she was continued on her home albuterol/ipratropium nebulizer treatments, and maintained o sats >% on l nc (her baseline o requirement). . #"
"cad: stable, no c/o chest pain during hospitalization."
she was continued on her home asa and pravastatin. . #
htn: carvedilol was discontinued due to frequent episodes of hypotension (with sbp s-s).
she can resume as an outpatient if bp tolerates. . #
gout: patient was continued on her home allopurinol and did not have any pain concerning for a gout flare. . #
transitional issues: - patient maintained full code status throughout hospitalization. -
she will continue outpatient hemodialysis at dialysis center - she has follow-up scheduled with her pcp and her cardiologist.

"it not only showed multiple areas of sick colon consistent with your chron's disease, but also a non-bleeding ulcer in the bowel."
